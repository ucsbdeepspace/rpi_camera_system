# FTA Dual-Camera Timing Characterization

Characterizing Raspberry Pi 5 dual-camera (OV9281) timing performance for an FTA
beam-tracking closed-loop control system. Target set by Phil (Prof. Lubin):
10ms loop latency, disturbance band 10-20Hz beacon wobble.

This file is the living state of the project. Update it as findings change —
don't let it drift from what's actually true. Full prior conversation history
(pre-2026-07-08) is archived in `docs/archive/handoff_conversation_2026-07-08.txt`
for context, but treat *this* file as authoritative, not the archive.

## Settled configuration (validated, don't re-derive from scratch)

- **Architecture**: multiprocessing — two separate OS processes, one per camera.
  Threading was tried and discarded (GIL contention caused erratic skew). A
  single-process/single-thread sequential version was also tested and is
  clearly worse (tail latency 22-27ms vs 10-15ms).
- **Stream**: raw R8 (mono, no debayering needed — OV9281 is a monochrome sensor)
- **ROI**: full frame (0, 0, 640, 400), both cameras — small ROI previously
  caused a silent detection failure on one camera (bad box placement), full
  frame fixed it and costs negligible compute (~2-3% of per-frame time)
- **Exposure**: 1500µs, **Gain**: 4.0
- **Frame duration**: 3400µs is the last stable point (~282fps achieved, ~7ms
  mean latency, ~122Hz toggle frequency). 3228µs hangs the process — this is
  very close to the sensor's own rated max (309.79fps mode = ~3226µs native
  period), so 3228µs asks for the literal hardware ceiling and breaks.
- **buffer_count=2** confirmed better than buffer_count=1 (buffer_count=1
  nearly halved achieved fps — losing pipeline overlap between sensor readout
  and app processing, not a staleness benefit as might be assumed)

## Key numbers to keep straight (easy to conflate)

- GPIO-only loopback (no camera): 305,522 Hz / 3.27µs — confirms GPIO overhead
  is negligible
- Pure camera capture throughput (no LED/detection logic): ~282fps per camera,
  concurrent, no bandwidth contention between the two cameras
- Closed-loop confirmed-transition rate (LED test, AND-gated on both cameras):
  ~90-122Hz — roughly half of raw capture rate, because confirming a discrete
  transition requires waiting for the next frame after the one that was already
  mid-exposure at toggle time, plus an order-statistics penalty from waiting on
  whichever camera is slower each cycle

## Open question for Phil (not yet resolved)

Does the real FTA control algorithm need discrete step-and-confirm (~120Hz
applies) or continuous latest-frame tracking (~280fps range could apply, no
confirmation step needed)? This determines which number is actually the
relevant ceiling. **Ask before optimizing further in either direction.**

## Sensor-level crop/windowing — RESOLVED, not available (2026-07-08)

Investigated whether the OV9281 supports true sensor-level windowing (reducing
actual sensor readout, not just post-capture numpy slicing — software ROI
slicing was already tested and ruled out as a speed lever, costs <3% of frame
time regardless of size).

Queried both sensor subdevices directly via V4L2 subdev selection ioctls:

```
v4l2-ctl --list-devices   # find subdev paths from topology
media-ctl -d /dev/media0 -p   # cam0 -> /dev/v4l-subdev2
media-ctl -d /dev/media2 -p   # cam1 -> /dev/v4l-subdev5
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/v4l-subdevN --get-subdev-selection=pad=0,stream=0,target=crop
v4l2-ctl -d /dev/v4l-subdevN --get-subdev-selection=pad=0,stream=0,target=crop_bounds
```

(Note: `--subdev-device` flag from earlier notes doesn't exist in v4l2-ctl
1.30.1 on this image — use `-d /dev/v4l-subdevN --get-subdev-selection=...`
instead, plain `--get-selection` is for video-capture nodes, not subdevs.)

Result: `crop` == `crop_bounds` == `crop_default` == 1280x800 @ offset (8,8),
identical on both sensors. `native_size` is 1296x816 (the 8px border is just
optical-black trim, not a tunable margin). **Since crop already equals its own
bounds, there is no addressable range left to shrink — this driver/sensor
combo does not expose adjustable sensor-level windowing.** The 3400µs frame
duration floor is a hardware/driver limit, not a software gap. Don't re-chase
this lever unless a different driver/overlay is introduced.

## Hardware status

SD card was damaged once already, OS was reimaged from scratch, which
previously caused (both now fixed as of the reimage):

1. Missing `dtoverlay=ov9281,cam0` / `dtoverlay=ov9281,cam1` in
   `/boot/firmware/config.txt` (fresh image doesn't include third-party sensor
   overlays) — added, confirmed working.
2. One camera (`i2c@80000`) stopped being detected after reimage — I2C found
   the sensor but the CSI-2 high-speed link never came up (zero errors, just
   silent). Root cause never fully confirmed — swapped the two cameras'
   physical ports to isolate port-vs-camera fault, and both cameras came back
   working after the swap, suggesting a loose/marginal connection rather than
   permanent damage.

**Re-verified 2026-07-08**: `rpicam-hello --list-cameras` shows both sensors
detected (`i2c@88000` and `i2c@80000`). **Still not stress-tested for
stability** — run `led_dual_camera_closed_loop_test_mp.py 3400` a few times
and watch for intermittent failures before fully trusting the `i2c@80000`
connection under sustained load.

Also note: 2 spare Raspberry Pis + 2 spare cameras have been ordered. Ribbon
cable is printed "HBV-Raspberry-160FPC" — useful search string for exact
camera module matching if needed later.

## Scripts (all at repo root)

- `led_dual_camera_closed_loop_test_mp.py` — **main validated test**, takes
  frame duration as CLI arg, defaults to 3400
- `led_dual_camera_sweep_subprocess.py` — sweeps frame duration via fresh
  subprocess per value (the reliable pattern — in-process reconfiguration
  between durations was tried and found unreliable)
- `camera_throughput_test.py` — pure capture rate, no LED, solo or concurrent
  (0/1/01 arg)
- `camera_preview.py` — live visual preview, 1 or 2 cameras, for basic sanity
  checks
- `led_dual_camera_closed_loop_test_single_process.py`,
  `led_dual_camera_closed_loop_test_mp_buf1.py` — comparison baselines,
  already answered their questions, probably don't need to run again
- `led_dual_camera_pooled_capture_test.py`, `led_dual_camera_sequential_test.py`,
  `led_skew_test_driver_cam0.py`, `led_skew_test_logger_cam1.py`,
  `led_skew_test_correlate.py` — leftover intermediate versions from earlier
  iterations, superseded, kept for reference only
- Others (`led_calibrate_raw.py`, `led_centroid_test_raw.py`,
  `led_centroid_test_rgb.py`, `led_exposure_sweep_raw.py`,
  `led_exposure_sweep_rgb.py`, `led_timing_test_raw.py`,
  `led_dual_camera_frame_duration_sweep.py`,
  `led_dual_camera_frame_duration_sweep_mp.py`,
  `led_dual_camera_skew_test.py`) — earlier calibration/exposure/skew work,
  reference only

`results/` holds sweep CSVs/PNGs. `docs/` holds the current slide deck
(`camera_timing_characterization.pptx`) and the conversation archive.

## Standing caution

Requesting a frame duration below the sensor's true floor can hang the process
with no catchable Python exception — happened at 3228µs. Any further downward
exploration needs one-value-at-a-time testing in fresh processes, watching the
terminal, ready to kill/reboot. Camera driver state is uncertain after any such
hang — reboot before trusting subsequent runs.

## Next steps (as of 2026-07-08)

1. Stress-test `i2c@80000` reconnection: run
   `led_dual_camera_closed_loop_test_mp.py 3400` several times, watch for
   intermittent failures.
2. Get Phil's answer on discrete-step vs. continuous tracking (determines
   whether ~120Hz or ~280fps is the real ceiling to design around).
